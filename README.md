Welcome to our website on emergency communications (EmComm) for the average family or individual. We understand the importance of being prepared in times of crisis, especially in light of recent disaster situations in the United States where communications have been interrupted or unavailable. Whether it's a hurricane, wildfire, or other natural disaster, or a man-made emergency such as a power outage or cyberattack, being able to communicate with loved ones and emergency responders is critical. 

Our focus is on inexpensive, off the shelf radios and equipment that operate on the 2-meter, 70cm, GMRS, and FRS frequency bands, which can help you stay connected when traditional means of communication are down. Our team is led by a retired US military veteran with extensive experience in responding to natural and man-made disasters, and we are dedicated to helping others become better prepared for the unexpected.

On our website, you will find equipment reviews and tests, guidance on developing a communications plan, tips for using digital messaging, and information on improvised antennas and power sources. Thank you for joining us, and we hope you find our resources helpful as you work to ensure the safety and security of your family and community.
